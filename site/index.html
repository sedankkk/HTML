            CHEESECAKE...
          </h1>  <p>
            Over 4,000 years ago in the fifth century BC, the ancient Greeks on the island of Samos created the earliest known cheesecake. This rudimentary cheesecake was made with patties of fresh cheese that were then pounded smooth with flour and honey.
         </p> 
         <p>
            
            The creation was then baked on an earthenware griddle before being enjoyed by the masses. Back then, cheesecake was considered a great source of energy and there is evidence showing it was served to athletes during the first Olympic Games in 776 BC. Cheesecake was also popular as a wedding dessert!

            SUFFLE
        </h1>
        <p>
            For an entire week last year, I ate Grand Marnier soufflé for dessert. The scene was delightfully retro: a French restaurant on a Celebrity cruise while vacationing with my 70-year-old parents. The dining room was swathed in table linens and brocade drapes. Men wore jackets and ties, while women were done up in beaded dresses that caught the light. As servers filleted fish tableside and diners selected cheeses from a wheeled cart, I dreamed of the soufflé at the end of the meal: the lofty golden puff when it first arrives.

            MACARON
        </h1>
        <p>
            
            According to popular beliefs, macarons are considered to be of Italian origin, dating back to the 8th Century. According to legends, the delicacy was introduced to France in 1533 when Queen Catherine de’ Medici of Italy married King Henry II of France, and her pastry chefs brought the macaron recipe with them. Back then, these cookies were made from almonds, egg white, and sugar, and called “priest’s bellybuttons.”. It is believed that macarons were served in 1581 during the marriage of the Duke of Joyeuse in Ardeche. In 1682, when King Louis XIV decided to stay at Versailles in 1682, macarons were served to the guests as a welcome gesture. Until then, macarons were considered an exclusive item for the royals. The tradition kept going until the empire fell in 1789.
